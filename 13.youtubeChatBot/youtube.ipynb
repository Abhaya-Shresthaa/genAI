       "\"Hey, heat. Hey. It's been exactly one year since Donald Trump took office. He was inaugurated on this day in 2025, January 20th. Everyone knew it was going to be chaotic. After all, this was an experienced and vengeful Trump. He wouldn't spare anyone, not allies, not adversaries. But I'm sure no one expected this level of drama. One year into his presidency, the most pressing issue is not Ukraine or Iran. It is Greenland. Trump is adamant about taking over this island. He wants Europe and Denmark to serve it on a platter. And if they don't, Trump is threatening tariffs starting in February. At first, Europe criticized this move, but now they want talks. They are trying to reason with the US president. First, the NATO chief reached out. He sent a message to Donald Trump. A message that Trump leaked on social media. Listen to this. Dear Donald, I will use my media engagements in Davos to highlight your work in Syria, in Gaza, and in Ukraine. I am committed to finding a way forward in Greenland. Can't wait to see you. Trump released it. A private message. This is diplomacy in Trump's world. Leaders do not call or exchange letters. They shoot direct messages on their phones and the language. This is flattery on steroids. In this case, Trump agreed to a meeting. He will attend the World Economic Forum at Davos tomorrow and while there he will meet European leaders. It's a chance for them to sway Trump. Another meeting was pitched by French President Emanuel Macron again on text. Macron sent a text to to Trump and Trump posted this message as well. Here's what it says. We are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran. I do not understand what you're doing on Greenland. I can set up a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday. Let us have dinner together in Paris before you go back to the US. That's Macron's message to Donald Trump. It's not clear if Trump has accepted this invite. If he has, brace for an awkward meeting because yesterday Donald Trump unloaded on Macron. The French president has refused to join his Gaza Board of Peace and Trump did not take it well. >> Nobody wants it because he's going to be out of office very soon. So, you know, that's all right. What I'll do is if they feel like cost, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join. If he if he said that, you're probably giving it to me a little bit differently. But if he actually did say that, but as you know, he's going to be out of office in a few months. >> A dinner after that, we say good luck to Macron. Either way, the Europeans are making a lastditch effort. They're trying to reign in Donald Trump. The question is, will it work? All indications are that it won't. Trump has posted two AI images on his social media. The first one shows Canada as part of the United States. The other one shows him planting the US flag in Greenland. So Trump is not backing down. Yesterday he reiterated his earlier message that America must have Greenland. >> We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can't protect it. Denmark, they're wonderful people. And I know the leaders, they're very good people, but they they don't even go there. And you know, because the boat went there 500 years ago and then left, that doesn't give you title to property. >> He's introduced a new angle to his claim. At first, Trump was asking Denmark to give up Greenland, meaning he acknowledged Danish rights over this island. But now he's questioning those very same Danish rights. We saw that in a message that he wrote to Norway's prime minister. Listen to what Trump said. Why does Denmark have a right of ownership anyway? There are no written documents. It's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there also. Clearly, Trump is building a case. He's questioning Denmark's rights over Greenland. The problem is that's none of his business. Greenland's prime minister has rejected Trump's moves. Greenland's people have rejected him. Denmark has rejected him. So, the diplomatic option is off the table. Europe will not offer Greenland willingly, which leaves the other option, coercion. Will Trump use American military force to capture Greenland? He was asked this question yesterday, and what was his response? No comment. It was not a no. Meaning military options could still be on the table. Trump says Europe should focus on the war in Ukraine. They should not be focusing on Greenland. So military coercion is very much possible. The other option is economic coercion. Trump has threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries. Many of them are weighing a strong response. But the US Treasury Secretary has warned against it. He wants Europe to let things play out. >> We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else. >> Not the Europeans. This question. Uh, I I think it would be very unwise. >> Plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape. So, our response will be unflinching, united, and proportional. And this is why we are working on a package to support Arctic security. First principle, full solidarity with Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark. The sovereignity and integrity of their territory is nonnegotiable. So all eyes are are on Davos. Though frankly, don't get your hopes up. Trump has gone too far to give up on Greenland and Europe cannot be seen as surrendering their territory. It's a perfect stalemate that raises the risks of a military attack. And the worst part, there is nothing to stop them. Yes, the attack would fracture and probably end NATO, but as an operation, it has no risk. The Danes are not about to fight the US military, so Greenland is basically a sitting duck. Let's see if diplomacy can bring things back from the brink. >> The world doesn't fit in boxes, so why should your news? From battlefields to negotiation tables, from internet outrage to real world injustice, >> the conversations everyone is having and the ones they're avoiding. It's the same show, but this new year, First Post America gets a new look. I'm Carrie Johnston and this is First Post America. >> Want the facts? The latest developments, >> news that gets straight to the point. >> Well, we've got all three just for you. This is First Post Live, a brand new show, your window into what really matters. >> Don't miss it.\""
